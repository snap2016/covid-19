Covid-19's Impact on Nature</h1>

<p style="color:#000080;">Covid-19, This one virus has created havoc around the world. Have you ever wondered where it all started? The origin is not confirmed, but the theory is the virus started from bats. Also, it's suspected that it’s a bioweapon that is made in a Chinese lab. The place where it started is in a city called ‘Wuhan’ in China.Covid-19 has a very big impact on humans as well as our environment.</p>
<p style="color:#000080;">Covid-19 leads to regress use of PPE Kits, masks , gloves, face sheilds etc. But when this the protective gear is not disposed of properly it creates a negative impact on nature.If the gear is disposed properly and not being thrown in the environment we can avoid the problem.</p>

<p style="color:#000080;">As the protective gear is made from plastic,plastic materials take thousands of years to break down and mix into soil and also release harmful chemicals in soil which take lives of microorganisims and insects , ruin the fertility of the soil, When plastic materials are thrown in water bodies it could be a serious threat on marine life etc .</p>

<ul>
<li>Biodegradeable waste<i>-biodegradable waste is any organic matter which can be broken down in soil by microorganisims and other living creatures.</i>
<li>Non-biodegradeable waste<i>-Waste which cannot be broken down in soil by natural processes.</i>
<li>Domestic Harzadous<i>-Waste which is harmful for the environment or human health.</i>
<ul>

<p style="color:#000080;">To prevent problems caused by covid-19 protective gear we should dispose the gear properly in a specific manner. Biodegradeable waste goes in a green bin. Non-biodegradable waste goes in a blue bin. Domestic harzadous waste goes in leak free yellow bags. You can also recycle PPE kits. I hope now to will dispose of the gear properly, protect yourself and the environment.</p>
